The opening of the cosmetics market in China came relatively late, with international mid-to-high-end cosmetics brands such as Lancome and L'Oreal entering the Chinese market in the 1990s. During this period, department store counters were the main marketing method for such beauty brands, and the emergence of beauty concept stores occurred between 2000 and 2010. After 2010, with the development of information technology, domestic and international brands gradually went online, and the online store dividend gradually declined. Offline channels once again gained attention from major beauty brands, and there was a trend of integration between online and offline sales channels. Under the influence of beauty e-commerce, the penetration rate of concept stores continued to decline. According to the analysis of the market size of cosmetics in China, from 2016 to 2020, the penetration rate of beauty concept stores in the cosmetics industry in China remained at around 70% and showed a gradual downward trend. In 2020, the development and penetration rate of beauty concept stores in China was 66.1%.

To explore the marketing of new media marketing strategies on integrated beauty concept stores, this paper aims to analyze the current situation of Watsons' new media marketing based on the main methods of new media marketing and the 4P theory. Firstly, by classifying new media marketing into social media marketing, content marketing, and influencer marketing, we will carefully sort out and summarize Watsons' new media marketing strategies. Secondly, using the 4P theory, namely product, price, place, and promotion, and combining with the main methods of new media marketing, we will conduct a deep analysis of Watsons' product positioning, pricing strategy, channel selection, and promotion tactics on new media platforms. Finally, based on empirical research and case analysis, we will summarize the strengths and weaknesses of Watsons' new media marketing and propose corresponding suggestions and improvement measures to further enhance its brand influence and market competitiveness.
